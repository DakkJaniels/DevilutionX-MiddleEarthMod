Izual was an angel who was given charge of the holy ruin blade, Azurewrath. Leading a daring assault on the Hellforge, Izual was set upon by hundreds of blackened demons, and was fatally wounded! The fiends cast the dying angel into a dark pit, where the powers of chaos transformed him, as he drowned in a whirlpool of burning blood! Evil possessed Izual! The feathers of his wings burned away to reveal leathery skin, and horns ripped through the flesh of his head! When he finally arose from that black pit, Izual was an angel no more!
