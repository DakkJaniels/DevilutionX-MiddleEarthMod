# Installing

First, you will need access to the game's MPQ files.
- Locate `DIABDAT.MPQ` on your CD, or in the [GoG](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo) installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)).
- For the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will also need `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.
- DevilutionX comes with [devilutionx.mpq](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/devilutionx.mpq) which is required to run the game properly.
- Chinese, Korean, and Japanese users will also need [fonts.mpq](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/fonts.mpq) or the text will be missing.
- For Polish voice support you need [pl.mpq](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/pl.mpq)
- For Russian voice support you need [ru.mpq](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/ru.mpq)

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases) for your system (if available) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing, or [build from source](building.md). Then follow the system-specific instructions below.

<details><summary>Android</summary>

First install the App via one of these 3 methods:
  - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.diasurgical.devilutionx)
  - Copy the APK file to the device and tap on it in the device's file explorer and follow the instructions

</details>

<details><summary>iOS & iPadOS</summary>

Certain sideloading applications exist which can let you install IPA packages to your device such as AltStore (https://altstore.io/) and Sideloadly (https://sideloadly.io/). Using such a sideloading application, install the .ipa file to your iDevice.

Once the App is installed, launch it once. It will say that it cannot find the data file (.MPQ). This is ok. Close the game. Do not skip this step as it will create your Documents folder that you will need to access in later steps.

There are 3 way to get install the MPQs. Make sure to have installed the app and have launched it once before attempting to copy over the MPQ files.

Method 1: Using the files.app

- Using the files.app, navigate to "On My iPhone / On My iPad"

![ios_mpq_files01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1339414/145088910-5664aed6-3a53-43f4-8088-834796792f68.png)

- Copy the MPQs to the devilutionx directory. Your directory should look like on the picture below

![ios_mpq_files02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1339414/145089068-2c87887b-58c3-4759-9270-9d8934fe90bb.png)

- Go back to your home screen and launch the game

Method 2: Using Finder (MacOS)

On more recent versions of MacOS, iTunes is no more. Instead you can use Finder to directly copy data to and from your iDevices

- Connect your iDevice to your computer and click on the "Files" tab.

- Drag and drop the MPQ files on the devilutionx directory

Method 3: Using iTunes (Windows and older MacOS)

- Connect you iDevice to your computer and launch iTunes

- Click on your device and in the files tab drag and drop the MPQ files to the devilutionx directory

</details>
  
<details><summary>Nintendo Switch</summary>

- Copy `devilutionx.nro` in into `/switch/devilutionx`
- Copy the MPQ files to `/switch/devilutionx`.
- Launch `devilutionx.nro` by holding R the installed game. Do not use the album to launch, if you use the album, the homebrew will only have a small amount of memory available, and the touch keyboard won't work. This is true for all homebrew, not just DevilutionX.

</details>

<details><summary>Nintendo 3DS</summary>

Download `devilutionx.cia` from the [latest release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest) and place it on your SD card.
This file will be used later to install the game on the 3DS console.

Copy the MPQ files to the `devilutionx` subfolder under the `3ds` folder on your SD card (`/3ds/devilutionx`). The game will read these files from this location.
You do not need a copy of `devilutionx.mpq` on your SD card to run the game on 3DS.
To avoid errors when you run the game, if you have an old version of `devilutionx.mpq` in the folder, you should remove it now.

Put the SD card back into the 3DS console and then power it on.
Use a title manager such as [FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI) to install `devilutionx.cia`.
You will no longer need `devilutionx.cia` after this step, and so it can be removed after the installation.

FBI provides the `Remote Install` option to download and install a cia in one step by scanning a QR code using the Nintendo 3DS camera.
This is most useful when upgrading from a previous version so that you can perform the installation without removing the SD card from the console.
If you'd like to use this option, scan the QR code below.
