# Nintendo Switch Port of DevilutionX (Diablo)

# How To Install:
 - Put `devilutionx.nro` and `devilutionx.mpq` in into `/switch/devilutionx`
 - Copy diabdat.mpq from your CD (or GoG install folder) to `/switch/devilutionx`.
 - To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will need to also copy hellfire.mpq, hfmonk.mpq, hfmusic.mpq, hfvoice.mpq.
 - For Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text support download https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/fonts.mpq and add it to the game folder.
 - For the Polish voice pack download https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/pl.mpq.
 - For the Russian voice pack download https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/ru.mpq.
 - Launch `devilutionx.nro`. (Do not use album to launch; see the note below.)
 - *Note:* Hold R on any installed game and launch it. Do not use album to launch. If you use album, the homebrew will only have a small amount memory available, and the touch keyboard won't work. This is true for all homebrew, not just DevilutionX.
