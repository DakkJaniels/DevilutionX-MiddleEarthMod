Middle Earth Mod created by Varaya and Khan for Diablo 1.07, now ported to Devilution X.

Based on data files I had for the Mod, and a copy of the modified binary I compared to Diablo 1.07, I think I've determined most, if not all of the changes that V&K implemented in Diablo. To play the mod, compile the source as described in the readme, then copy the folders in the `ME Mod assets.zip` file to the assets folder in your build folder (or to the assets folder wherever the executable file is located). In addition, you have to copy your `DIABDAT.MPQ` file to the location of the executable or have your Diablo CD in your disc drive.

NOTE: MOD IS **NOT** DESIGNED FOR HELLFIRE AND IS FOR MULTIPLAYER ONLY (use loopback if you are playing on your own). While I'm sure this could be fixed to make single player work, all the tables were copied over just like they were written originally (for the most part), so if that overwrote unique monsters and/or items, they will not work correctly in single-player.

# What is DevilutionX

DevilutionX is a source port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features.

Check out the [manual](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki) for what features are available and how best to take advantage of them.

For a full list of changes see our [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Alternately you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will need to also copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.

For more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).
